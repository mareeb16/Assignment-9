    <center><p>A laptop, also known as a notebook computer, is a portable personal computer designed for ease of use and portability. It typically has a clamshell form factor with a screen on the upper lid and a keyboard and touchpad on the lower lid. Laptops are powered by batteries and can be used without being plugged into an outlet, making them ideal for use on the go or in different locations. </p></center>
